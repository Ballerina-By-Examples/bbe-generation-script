// start calls a function asynchronously and the function runs on a separate logical thread ("strand"): cooperatively multitasked by default
// Result will be of type `future<T>` and `future` is a separate basic type.
// Waiting for the same future more than once gives an error.
// Use `f.cancel()` to terminate a future.
