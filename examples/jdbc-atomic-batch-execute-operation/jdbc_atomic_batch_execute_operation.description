// This BBE demonstrates how to use the JDBC client to execute a batch of
// DDL/DML operations with the help of a `transaction` to achieve the atomic behaviour.
// Note that the relevant database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml`
// file as a dependency. 
// This sample is based on an H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR need to be added to `Ballerina.toml` file.
// For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [JDBC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/) <br><br>
