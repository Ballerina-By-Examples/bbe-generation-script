// Ballerina does not have exceptions. Errors are reported by functions returning
// error values.
// `error` is its own basic type.
// The return type of a function that may return an error value will be a union with error.
// An error value includes a `string` message.
// An error value includes stack trace from the point where `error(msg)` is called.
// Error values are immutable.
