// Object is a separate basic type.
// An object value has named methods and fields.
// Methods and fields are in the same symbol space.
// A class both defines an object type and provides a way to construct an object.
// Apply `new` operator to a class to get an object.
// Call method using `obj.foo(args)`.
// Access field using `obj.x`.
