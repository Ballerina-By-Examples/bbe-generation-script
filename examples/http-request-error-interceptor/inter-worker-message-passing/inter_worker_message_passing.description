// Use `-> W` or `<- W` to send a message to or receive a message from worker `W` (use
// `function` to refer to the function's default worker).
// Messages are copied using `clone()`; implies immutable values are passed
// without copy.
// Message sends and receives are paired up at compile-time.
// Each pair turns into horizontal line in the sequence diagram.
// Easy to use and safe, but limited expressiveness.
